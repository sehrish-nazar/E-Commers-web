## Defining Technical Requirements for Sanity CMS as Backend
The backend for the marketplace will be powered by **Sanity CMS**, a headless content management system that will act as the database to manage and serve structured data. This ensures a scalable and flexible backend infrastructure to support the marketplace's needs.

### 1. Core Functions of Sanity CMS
- **Product Data Management:**
  - Store and manage product details, including names, descriptions, prices, stock levels, categories, and images.
  - Enable dynamic updates to product listings without redeploying the frontend.
- **Customer Data Management:**
  - Maintain customer records, including account details, shipping addresses, and order histories.
  - Support personalized experiences and targeted interactions.
- **Order Records:**
  - Store order information, such as product details, customer data, payment status, and order timestamps.
  - Facilitate seamless order tracking and management.

### 2. Sanity CMS as the Database
- **Structured Content:**
  - Define custom schemas for products, customers, and orders to align with the marketplace's data requirements.
- **Real-Time Updates:**
  - Sanityâ€™s real-time APIs ensure that changes in the backend are immediately reflected on the frontend.
- **Scalability:**
  - Flexible schema definitions allow for future expansion (e.g., adding new fields for promotions, reviews, or shipment tracking).

### 3. Key Schemas
- **Product Schema:**
  - Fields: `name`, `price`, `description`, `image`, `category`, `stock`, `rating`.
- **Customer Schema:**
  - Fields: `name`, `email`, `password`, `address`, `orderHistory`.
- **Order Schema:**
  - Fields: `orderID`, `customerID`, `products`, `totalAmount`, `status`, `orderDate`.

### 4. Integration with Frontend
- **API Queries:**
  - Use GROQ (Graph-Relational Object Queries) to fetch data from Sanity CMS efficiently.
  - Example Queries:
    - Fetch all products: `*[_type == "product"]`
    - Fetch orders by customer ID: `*[_type == "order" && customerID == $id]`
- **Data Flow:**
  - Sanity CMS serves as the source of truth, providing content for the frontend via dynamic Next.js routes.

### 5. Why Sanity CMS?
- **Customizable:** Allows the creation of tailored schemas to fit marketplace needs.
- **Content Studio:** Provides an intuitive interface for managing content, making it easy for non-technical users to update data.
- **Real-Time Collaboration:** Supports simultaneous updates by multiple team members.
- **Built-In APIs:** Offers powerful, out-of-the-box APIs for CRUD operations, reducing backend complexity.

By using Sanity CMS as the backend, the marketplace will have a robust, flexible, and efficient database solution to support content management and ensure seamless integration with the frontend.
