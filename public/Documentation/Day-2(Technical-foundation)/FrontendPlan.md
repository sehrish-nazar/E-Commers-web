## Defining Technical Requirements for the Frontend
To ensure a seamless user experience, the frontend of the website will be designed with the following considerations:

### 1. Framework Selection

  - **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** Ensures dynamic pages load quickly by generating HTML on the server.
  - **Static Site Generation (SSG):** Boosts performance for pages like the home and about pages by pre-generating content during the build process.
  - **API Routes:** Provides built-in API routing capabilities, simplifying the integration of backend services.

### 2. User-Friendly Interface
- The website will have a clean, intuitive, and accessible layout to enhance user engagement.
- Navigation will be simple and structured, allowing users to find desired sections and perform actions effortlessly.

### 3. Responsiveness
- The design will be fully responsive, ensuring optimal functionality and appearance on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Tailwind CSS** will be used to implement responsive utilities efficiently, supporting multiple screen sizes and resolutions.

### 4. Pages and Features
The website will include the following core pages:
- **Home Page:** Highlights the marketplace's value proposition, featured products, and promotions.
- **About Page:** Shares information about the business, its mission, and values.
- **Product Page:** Displays all products with sorting and filtering options for easy browsing.
- **Product Detail Page:** Shows detailed information about selected products and includes "Add to Cart" and "Add to Wishlist" buttons.
- **Cart Page:** Summarizes selected items, with options to update quantities or proceed to checkout.
- **Wishlist Page:** Allows users to save products for later reference.
- **Order Completed Page:** Confirms successful order placement with a summary of the order details.
- **Contact Page:** Includes a form for inquiries and displays business contact details.
- **Login/Signup Pages:** Supports secure user authentication with options for password reset and social login.

### 5. Technology Stack
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS for rapid, utility-first styling and consistent design.
- **State Management:** React Query to efficiently manage and sync frontend state with backend APIs.
