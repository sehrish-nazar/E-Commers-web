## Defining Technical Requirements for Third-Party APIs
To enhance the functionality and user experience of the marketplace, **Third-Party APIs** will be integrated for critical backend services. These APIs will ensure seamless operations for shipment tracking, payment processing, and other essential services, while providing the necessary data for frontend functionality.

### 1. Core Functions of Third-Party APIs
- **Shipment Tracking:**
  - Integrate with a shipment tracking API to provide real-time updates on the status and location of orders.
  - Allow users to track their orders directly from the frontend interface.
  - Example API Data:
    - Endpoint: `/shipment-status`
    - Response: `{ "orderId": 123, "status": "In Transit", "ETA": "2025-01-20" }`
- **Payment Gateway:**
  - Use a secure payment gateway API (e.g., Stripe, PayPal, or Razorpay) to handle transactions.
  - Ensure secure processing of payments, including support for credit cards, digital wallets, and other payment methods.
  - Example API Workflow:
    - Initiate payment: `/create-payment-intent`
    - Confirm payment: `/confirm-payment`

### 2. Integration Workflow
- **Frontend Interaction:**
  - APIs will be called based on user actions, such as order placement or tracking requests.
  - Data received from APIs will be dynamically displayed on the website.
- **Backend Processing:**
  - Sanity CMS will store the relevant data fetched from third-party APIs (e.g., order shipment updates or payment statuses).
- **Error Handling:**
  - Implement robust error handling to manage failed API requests or invalid responses.
  - Display user-friendly error messages in case of issues.

### 3. Technical Considerations
- **Authentication:**
  - Use API keys, OAuth tokens, or other authentication mechanisms to securely access third-party APIs.
- **Rate Limiting:**
  - Adhere to the rate limits defined by APIs to avoid overuse or throttling.
- **Data Security:**
  - Ensure sensitive information like payment details is transmitted and stored securely (e.g., use HTTPS and encryption).
- **Caching:**
  - Cache API responses (where appropriate) to improve performance and reduce unnecessary calls.
- **Monitoring:**
  - Use tools like Postman or API management platforms to monitor and debug API calls during development.

### 4. Frontend Integration Examples
- **Shipment Tracking Example:**
  - **Endpoint:** `/shipment-status`
  - **Method:** `GET`
  - **Frontend Workflow:**
    1. User views their order details.
    2. Frontend sends a request to the shipment API with the order ID.
    3. API response provides the shipment status and estimated delivery date.
    4. Status is displayed in real-time on the frontend.
- **Payment Processing Example:**
  - **Endpoint:** `/create-payment-intent`
  - **Method:** `POST`
  - **Frontend Workflow:**
    1. User confirms their cart and proceeds to checkout.
    2. Payment API generates a payment intent.
    3. User completes the payment using their preferred method.
    4. Confirmation is sent to both the user and the backend.

### 5. Why Use Third-Party APIs?
- **Efficiency:** Avoid reinventing the wheel by leveraging pre-built solutions for complex functionalities.
- **Reliability:** Ensure robust and tested services for critical tasks like payments and shipments.
- **Scalability:** Easily integrate additional APIs in the future as the marketplace expands.

By integrating third-party APIs, the marketplace will deliver essential functionalities such as real-time tracking, secure payments, and more, providing a seamless and professional experience for users.
